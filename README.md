## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Simon, a fullstack developer based in Poland.

I like combining my technical knowledge with design to make beautiful and efficient applications. My goal is to build scalable and efficient web apps while providing engaging and flawless user experiences.

Outside of work, I'm interested in furthering my knowledge in the tech world. I also build many side projects.

I'm currently learning Python and Data Science. I'm also developing my web skills using Next.js.

### Fun Facts:
- I love coffee.
- The Walking Dead is my favorite series.
- Naruto: ShippÅ«den is my favorite anime.
